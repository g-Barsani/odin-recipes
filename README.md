# odin-recipes

A recipe website that applies everything taught so far in the TOP curriculum:

- First use of the Git tool
- Elements and tags
- Text
- Lists
- Links and images

The website has a main index page with a few recipes links

# Process

It all started on my notebook because I first sketched the layout a wanted there. It turned out quite similar to what I have planned.
After this I wrote the HTML structure for the main page & recipes pages. When it was the time to add the CSS, it took me more time because I kept adding new features I thought would improve the user experience.
But what kept me really busy was trying to make this project responsive in mobile and desktop screens. It took me a few attempts, but fortunately I got right. 
I tested it on a couple of cellphones, my laptop and even in the television screen.

# Conclusion

I'm much more comfortable with Git. After all, it was just a few commands that I had to get used, but I'm willing to deepen my knowledge on this tool.
The whole process thought me about doing the research to implement the things I thought out. I'm certainly interested in improving my technical knowledge so I can build cool things that are well structured faster.
