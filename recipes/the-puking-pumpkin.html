        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If there's one recipe you need this Halloween it's the Puking Pumpkin. Cause really, who doesn't want a pumpkin throwing up guacamole all over Halloween?</p>
        <p>Folks, it's that time of the year again when we start making extremely questionable recipes in the name of Halloween. The puking pumpkin is no exception to that. Itâ€™s kinda beautiful though right? I mean as beautiful as a barfing pumpkin can be.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large Pumpkin</li>
            <li>1 tray of Tortilla Chips (approx 14oz/400g)</li>
            <li>2 cups / 200g Cheddar, grated</li>
            <li>1 cup Salsa, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup Guac, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Sour Cream, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut out a small circle at the tip of the Pumpkin, big enough to comfortably fit your hand in. Using a spoon, scoop out all the center of the Pumpkin. Draw on the style of face you want, then carefully carve out. Ensure the mouth is open to allow the guac to pour out.</li>
            <li>Arrange chips on a tray and evenly top with cheese. Pop in the oven at 180C/350F for 10-15mins or until the cheese is just melted.</li>
            <li>Pour over salsa, then sour cream and top with guac (making sure it's coming out of the pumpkin's mouth). Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
